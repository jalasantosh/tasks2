Comparable

- int objOne.compareTo(objTwo)	
- "I can compare myself with another object"
- in Java it is used to implement natural ordering of objects 
- there's a single natural default comparison
- we must modify the class whose instances you want to sort
- it's in the same class
- only one implementation 
- implemented frequently in the API by: String, Wrapper classes, 
  Date, Calendar.

Comparator 

- int compare(objOne, objTwo)
- "I can compare two other objects." 
- multiple ways of comparing two instances of a type - e.g. we  
  could compare people by age, name etc.
- we can provide comparators for classes that we do not control
- multiple implementations
- meant to be implemented to sort instances of third-party
  classes.
